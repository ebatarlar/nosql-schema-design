# NoSQL Schema Design

An interactive web application designed to help developers make informed decisions about NoSQL database schema design, with a particular focus on MongoDB schema patterns and best practices.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This tool helps developers learn and apply NoSQL schema design principles through interactive components:

- **Embed vs. Reference Decision Quiz**: An interactive questionnaire that helps determine whether to embed or reference related data in your NoSQL schema
- More interactive tools coming soon!

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The React framework for production
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - For UI components

## 🗺️ Future Plans

- [ ] Add more interactive decision tools for schema design
- [ ] Include case studies of real-world NoSQL schema designs
- [ ] Add visualization tools for schema relationships
- [ ] Provide performance comparison simulations
- [ ] Add more NoSQL database types beyond MongoDB
